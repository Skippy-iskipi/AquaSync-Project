# Password Reset Flow - Supabase Built-in System

## Overview
The password reset flow now uses Supabase's built-in authentication system, which is more secure and reliable.

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Requests Password Reset
1. User enters their email address in the app
2. App checks if the email exists in Supabase database
3. If email exists, sends password reset email via Supabase
4. If email doesn't exist, shows error message

### Step 2: User Receives Email
1. Supabase sends a password reset email with a secure link
2. Email contains a link that opens the app
3. The link contains a secure token for verification

### Step 3: User Sets New Password
1. User clicks the link in the email
2. App opens and user is authenticated with the reset token
3. User enters new password and confirms it
4. App updates the password using Supabase's `updateUser()`
5. Shows loading animation for 3 seconds
6. Redirects to login screen

## Security Features

### ✅ Email Existence Check
- Before sending reset email, app verifies the email exists in database
- Prevents email enumeration attacks
- Shows appropriate error messages

### ✅ Secure Token Verification
- Uses Supabase's built-in token system
- Tokens are cryptographically secure
- Tokens expire automatically
- No custom code verification needed

### ✅ Password Validation
- Minimum 6 characters
- Must contain at least one letter
- Passwords must match confirmation
- Real-time validation feedback

### ✅ Loading States
- Shows loading animation during all operations
- Prevents multiple submissions
- Clear success/error feedback

## Error Handling

### Email Not Found
- "No account found with this email address"
- Prevents sending emails to non-existent accounts

### Network Errors
- "Cannot connect to authentication service"
- "Please check your internet connection"

### Password Validation
- "Password must be at least 6 characters"
- "Password must contain at least one letter"
- "Passwords do not match"

### Session Errors
- "No active session. Please try the password reset process again"
- Handles expired or invalid sessions

## User Experience

### Loading Animations
- Circular progress indicator during operations
- 3-second success animation before redirect
- Clear visual feedback for all states

### Success Flow
1. Email sent successfully
2. User clicks email link
3. App opens with authenticated session
4. User sets new password
5. Success message shown
6. 3-second loading animation
7. Redirect to login screen

### Error Recovery
- Clear error messages
- Option to try again
- "Send New Email" button for retry

## Technical Implementation

### AuthService Methods
- `checkUserExists()` - Verifies email in database
- `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Sends reset email via Supabase
- `updatePasswordAfterReset()` - Updates password after verification

### Deep Link Handling

- Handled in AndroidManifest.xml
- Routes to password reset screen

### State Management
- Loading states for all operations
- Error message handling
- Success state management
- Form validation

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Valid Email**: Should send reset email
2. **Invalid Email**: Should show "email not found" error
3. **Network Error**: Should show connection error
4. **Password Mismatch**: Should show validation error
5. **Weak Password**: Should show strength requirements
6. **Successful Reset**: Should redirect to login

### Email Testing
- Check email delivery
- Verify link functionality
- Test token expiration
- Confirm password update
