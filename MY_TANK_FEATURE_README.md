## Database Schema

### Tanks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tanks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  tank_shape TEXT NOT NULL,
  length DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  width DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  height DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  unit TEXT NOT NULL,
  volume DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  fish_selections JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  compatibility_results JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  feeding_recommendations JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  available_feeds JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  feed_inventory JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  date_created TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Usage Flow

### Creating a Tank
1. User navigates to "My Tank" tab
2. Clicks "Create Tank" button
3. Enters tank name and selects shape
4. Inputs dimensions (length, width, height)
5. Adds fish species with quantities
6. Checks fish compatibility
7. Generates feeding recommendations
8. Adds available feeds to inventory
9. Saves tank

### Managing Tanks
1. View tank list with overview cards
2. Tap tank to view detailed information
3. Edit tank details as needed
4. Delete tanks with confirmation
5. Monitor feed inventory status

### Compatibility Checking
- Real-time validation when fish are added
- Visual indicators for compatibility status
- Detailed compatibility issue reporting
- Recommendations for incompatible combinations

### Feeding Management
- AI-generated feeding schedules
- Feed inventory tracking
- Duration calculations for feed supply
